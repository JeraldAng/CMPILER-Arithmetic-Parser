# Parser Test Case 
This project aims to create my own simple parser for parsing input tokens, by using a scanner or lexical analyzer for input tokenization, and incorporating a panic mode error recovery.

# Running the program
The program created makes use of the Java programming language. The program must be run by using a compatible IDE. <br>

The <b>steps</b> to run the program are as follows:
1. Download the repository onto a computing device. 
2. Open the project in a compatible Java IDE (recommended: IntelliJ).
3. Run the program once the IDE fully loads.
4. Check the "output.txt" text file for the results. 
<br>
<b>The entry class file (where the main function is located) is named:</b><br>
"Main" in src -> Main.java file <br>

<b>To change the input:</b><br>
The program reads a file called "input.txt" located in the main directory. Simply change the contents of this file to process a new input. The program also reads a grammar input, named "grammar.txt". To check the output of the file, the "output.txt" in the same directory stores the results computed by the program. Coding-wise, these are found in the Main.java file.

line 10 - "grammar.txt" 
line 26 - "input.txt"
line 46 - "output.txt"
